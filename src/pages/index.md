# Welcome, camper

<p class="text-xl mb-4">⛺ Campsite is a fresh new static site generator, pack light, pitch fast, and build sites with a cozy developer experience.</p>

Campsite supports Markdown, Nunjucks, Liquid, Vue.js, and Alpine.js out of the box, plus Tailwind CSS for styling.

Get started by checking out the [documentation](./docs/) or jump right in with one of the following commands:

```bash
# Create a new Campsite project
npm create campsite@latest my-campsite-site
cd my-campsite-site
# Start the development server
npx campsitejs dev
```

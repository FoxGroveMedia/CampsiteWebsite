### Markdown Template Language

<p class="mb-8">Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows you to create formatted text using a plain-text editor. It is widely used for documentation, blogging, and content management systems, making it a great choice for CampsiteJS projects.</p>

#### Key Features of Markdown
- **Simplicity**: Easy to learn and use with minimal syntax.
- **Readability**: Designed to be readable in its raw form.
- **Extensibility**: Supports extensions for additional functionality.
- **Compatibility**: Works well with various static site generators and content management systems.

#### Getting Started with Markdown in Campsite
1. **Installation**: Ensure Markdown support is included in your CampsiteJS project dependencies.
2. **Configuration**: Set up Markdown as your template engine in the CampsiteJS configuration file.
3. **Creating Templates**: Start creating `.md` files for your templates.
4. **Using Markdown Syntax**: Utilize Markdown syntax for headings, lists, links, images, and more.

### Headings
Use `#` for headings. The number of `#` symbols indicates the heading level.
```markdown
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
```
### Lists
Create unordered lists using `-`, `*`, or `+`, and ordered lists using numbers.
```markdown
- Item 1
- Item 2
  - Subitem 2.1
1. First Item
2. Second Item
```
### Links
Create links using the `[text](URL)` syntax.
```markdown
[Visit Campsite](https://campsite.dev)
```
### Images
Embed images using the `![alt text](image URL)` syntax.
```markdown
![CampsiteJS Logo](https://campsite.dev/logo.png)
```
